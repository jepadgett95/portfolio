          My name is Jacob Padgett and I have a passion for computers. I am
          currently attending Basecamp Coding Academy, and I look forward to
          graduating and finding a career as a software developer. I am a hard
          worker and a fast learner, and I am sure that I will thrive in a tech
          career.

          My first project I completed during BaseCamp was a Dungeons and
          Dragons character sheet creator. I worked as the team lead with four
          of my classmates, and was in charge of making sure that everyone's
          code was implemented seamlessly. We used a text file to hold all the
          information required in the process of creating a character, and our
          code would refer to that info as the user walks through the program.
          We also made use of a random number generator to roll the dice that
          dictate the character's stats. It is a complicated task to do by hand,
          but with the use of this program, it can be automated.

        <p class="info">
          For my second project, I worked with a team of four people to write a
          program that would help with cooking, meal planning, and shopping. The
          program pulls from a list of recipes saved in a text file which holds
          the description, ingredients, and directions for each recipe. After
          the user selects all the recipes they want, the program creates a new
          text file that lists all the ingredients required for all of the
          chosen recipes. This is everything you need to shop for during your
          next grocery trip.
