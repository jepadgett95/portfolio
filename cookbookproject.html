        For my second project, I worked with a team of four people to write a
        Python program that would help with cooking, meal planning, and
        shopping. The program pulls from a list of recipes saved in a text file
        which holds the description, ingredients, and directions for each
        recipe. After the user selects all the recipes they want, the program
        creates a new text file that lists all the ingredients required for all
        of the chosen recipes. This is everything you need to shop for during
        your next grocery trip.
