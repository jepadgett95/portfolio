        My first project I completed during BaseCamp was a Dungeons and Dragons
        character sheet creator coded in Python. I worked as the team lead with
        four of my classmates, and was in charge of making sure that everyone's
        code was implemented seamlessly. We used a text file to hold all the
        information required in the process of creating a character, and our
        code would refer to that info as the user walks through the program. We
        also made use of a random number generator to roll the dice that dictate
        the character's stats. It is a complicated task to do by hand, but with
        the use of this program, it can be automated.
